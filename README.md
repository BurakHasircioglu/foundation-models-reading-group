# _Robots in Disguise_: The Foundation Models Reading Group

Public repo for The Alan Turing Institute's reading group on foundation models as part of the activities of Foundational AI theme.

If you're based at the Turing, follow `#robots-in-disguise` on the Turing Slack for the most recent updates.

**To see all the slides and reading materials for previous sessions, see the [archive](PREVIOUS.md).**

Note that this originated from the [Research Engineering Team](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research-engineering)'s reading group on Transformers.

## Overview

The group meets every <b>week on Mondays at 11-12</b>. Everyone is welcome to join! If you have any questions email [Ryan](mailto:rchan@turing.ac.uk) or [Fede](mailto:fnanni@turing.ac.uk) and remember to go through our [Code of Conduct](CodeOfConduct.md) before joining.

Please **get in touch** if you would like to give a talk (either about your research or a topic you think is relevant to the reading group) add suggestions and emoji preferences to the [list of proposed topics](https://hackmd.io/4zHl_1G6Se-yumHTN48dqg?both) on HackMD!
