goomars i knew i was better than them as stupid as it sounds i viewed them as a form of masturbation for him i couldnt give him what he needed all the time youre a man you know that thirst i was too busy with the house and the kids to quench it but this psychiatrist you know shes not just a goomar now i feel like hes really cheating and im the one whos thirsty im not gonna stay in a marriage thats made lets not even think about that divorce is for those who never intended on dying married in the first place you know carm we reap what we sow what do you mean you admit to accepting his dalliances in the past schifosas they meant nothing but you said it was like they were lightening the workload providing a wifes duty when you were too busy you practically welcomed it now i want you to pray to our holy mother ask her for guidance and forgiveness so that you can get through this as a couple youre not without sin in this carmela so shes out of control she spends money like were the

cell i gotta call carmela you sure it was them they were drunk in gym class byron barber vomited all over the teacher i spat it out anthony youre gonna lie to me now hes sorry father hagy hell be sorrier when he gets home anthony why dont you wait outside hes suspended for three days let me pay for the wine this isnt just a crime against property its an affront to our holy sacristy ive asked dr galani our school psychologist to join us hes been keeping an eye on anthony meeting with his teachers why dont you pick it up from there doctor um hi in many respects anthony is a normal healthy 8thgrader sister patricia his art teacher thinks he shows strong skills in spatial orientation but the thing is and its not just this one incident anthony sometimes has trouble following the rules weighing consequences at times doesnt think before he acts and its thought that theres a good possibility anthony could be add add attention deficit disorder i knew it i knew there was something what is it its an aggregate of symptoms inattention impulsivity sometimes although not always hyperactivity to be sure well give him a thorough evaluation he needs a whack upside the head if hes got an illness its an illness right youd hit somebody whos sick youd hit somebody with polio you hit anthony nobody gets hit in our house not exactly my idea whats happening if you cant do a little tarantella on the kids when they step out of line so what happens now hell be given a complete battery of testing psychological behavioral medical let me ask you a question these other kids you keeping an eye on them are you testing them the ones that arent named soprano theres no immediate plans for that we attend to every child at verbum dei according to his own circumstances and so what do we as the parents do nothing oh no i mean anthonys misbehaved he should be consequenced its a crime to suspend that child from school with all the money you give them that gym teacher shit a brick when your friend puked on his boots huh anthony want to encourage him whatever happened to boys will be boys he stole from the church they dont make them any lower what a loser thats enough out of you oh his father was the same way i practically lived in that vice principals office could we not please you only remember what you want to remember yeah well i mustve had another son who stole a car when he was 10 years old he could barely see over the wheel junior he was a hellion him and his little crew they stole lobsters on the boats and sold them for a buck on bloomfield avenue really how many times must i say it i dont want that talk in front of him that is wrong and i dont condone it yeah sure who are you yelling at what you stupe what did you say i didnt say anything whats he doing now whats going on he yells at me anthony i thought this could wait till after dinner your father and i have talked you are not to play mario cart or go skateboarding for three weeks and no tv no carmela you wont sit on that internet and every day youll ride your bike to go visit grandma oh thatll be nice its not fair some fucking day huh i feel like a bomb went off you know that stuff the doctor said i never saw any of that in anthony you never notice how he picks at the tongue of his shoe like he cant help himself if he even has this thing somethings going on carm yep do you think he knows i dont know she knows are you really what makes you say that are you in i dont know things she says she makes remarks like this today with him are you in the mafia she talk to you about me talk to me something happen on that college trip happen like what i dont know she seemed peculiar when she got back i think pretty soon were gonna have to you know talk to her about the business yeah the two of us should sit down with meadow talk as a family with him theyll test him and well see whats what right good night good night maybe i dont want to admit somethings wrong with my kid but this sounds like bullshit what do you mean if hes got a disease why punish him isnt that bullshit add is a controversial subject is it a disease or a way for psychologists to line their pockets many children can really benefit by professional intervention he got in trouble so you dont consider his behavior out of the norm no i dont know what do i know about it what do you mean oh i gotta spell it out for you do you see his behavior as a reflection of your own look like i said maybe i dont want to admit theres something wrong but if hes got this thing well deal with it if he had polio wed deal with it you pick up the pieces and you go on from there so thats what were gonna do do you want to say anything else about this well last time you were telling me that you had intimate feelings for me but youve not mentioned it intimate feelings i think i said i was in love how are you doing with it i cant turn off my feelings because you say its a byproduct of therapy i never said to turn off your feelings well i already got a girlfriend shes russian 24 how old are you its interesting it took you so long to tell me you had a girlfriend how are you doing with it i gotta ask you one more question about my son you think i should go easy on him now or press him harder thats difficult to say what you want a raise maybe to figure this out carmela anthony anthony jr you get up aj why i dont have to

channel 6 turn on channel 6 new jersey attorney general james ricci stated at a fundraiser that a grand jury has been empaneled to investigate possible mob activities in the garden state with indictments to follow with us is syndicated columnist and author of mafia americas longestrunning soap opera jeffrey wernick welcome jeffrey pleasure to be here for years fbi has been telling us that the mafia is all but dead let me interject while it is true that the mob is getting a standing eightcount i wouldnt call the fight the government knows this best murder truck hijacking and money laundering are expected inquiries do we know names of those wholl be indicted jeffrey the indictments are sealed but with the recent death of acting di meo family boss jackie aprile my sources tell me that corrado junior soprano was made new boss after the death of aprile the sopranos have long historic ties to the new york families anchor what about possible murder charges jeffrey they will undoubtedly be focused on the as yet unsolved executionstyle slaying of soprano family associate brendan filone was it part of a power struggle anchor interesting no one would have ranked him as associate a loyal soldier and he winds up dead chris soldier brendan filone associate soldier fuck you jesus did you see it from the beginning did they mention my name stop the fucking chitchat all

fault i realize that youre involved in the antidefamation lobby so go after hollywood if you feel you must but leave my patient alone its a synergy news items and the portrayal of italianamericans as gangsters wasnt the italian antidef deal started by joe colombo a mobster italians against discrimination did a study in its height the mafia in the us had less than 5000 members and yet that tiny insignificant fraction casts such a dark shadow over 20 million hardworking americans at this point in our cultural history mob movies are classic american cinema like westerns i have to agree there

putting her in a home in your worst dreams a duck flies off with your penis castration my mother never went after my basket no not literally look ordinarily a patient is helped to make his own breakthroughs but your life is in danger so im willing to put the cards on the table i say what your mother has at the very least is borderline personality disorder borderline personality disorder let me read to you from the dsm form okay definitions of the condition a pattern of unstable relationships affective instability it means intense anxiety a joylessness their internal phobias are the only things that exist the real world real people are peripheral these people have no love or compassion borderline personalities are very good at splitting behavior creating bitterness and conflict between others in their circle you twisted fucking bitch thats my mother not some fuck in attica stab you in the shower relax were through you and i were finished youre lucky i dont break your face in

he would be right back phone rings tony all right go on go eat somewhere else hello counselor thanks for getting back to me so quick tony he says the indictment sounds better for the feds than it really is i wasnt named because the focus is some callingcard scam that junior and larry had and this diamante technical stock thing that i wasnt into thank god that prick altieri gave them reams of shit they got stuff on all of us from the surveillance at green grove they dont have a case an ongoing investigation the da said they always say that to make it sound good this is no fucking joke i

father i want to thank you for taking the time to talk to me the other day did you bring your wife into things no no sitting there in gods house i realized you can either be a yes person or a no person a positive ion or a negative ion im not quite sure i get what youre saying its just that this womans always been an odd bird a sea of negativity as a kid we took her ravings with a grain of salt but you also said the son was unstable i was angry complicated yes he is a little too comfortable outside the law yes he is but it would only add to the quotient of sorrow in the world to doubt him when the source is a person who rarely has a kind word for anyone you seem at peace i am father thank you again father sure okay artie conigliaro do you prefer corrado or junior i prefer mr soprano your tenure as boss was a short one actually it was unusual in several ways let me put this to you simply you can avoid these charges if you will testify that in fact you were not the boss of north jersey that in fact your nephew anthony soprano was and is that he de facto controlled your capos with the backing of new york communicating through their emissary john sacrimoni we want johnny sack but more than him we want mangano and teresi i want to fuck angie dickinson see who gets lucky first we want you to confirm information we have through informants and wiretap that you were allowed to profit but you were not making policy and were not in the loop you were positioned to take the hits and now you have the question is how long you gonna keep eating shit youre 70 years old

horrible to attend a premiere i dont even have the thing i threw it away what you have a copy i told you im not interested i believe in you engine starting it wasnt my fault you stole my car wheres the trust when i get confirmed ill be a man so why cant i drive you want to get into this whos that man we picked up at camp last year for bedwetting that was two years ago you could have killed those girls that would have been interesting what did you just say death shows the ultimate absurdity of life are you trying to get me to lose my temper im about to put you through that window see thats what i mean life is absurd dont say that god forgive you there is no god hey hey where is this coming from what do they teach you this crap at school is this this new english teacher mr clark where is he from answer me oberlin want him to read something other than hustler hello he got assigned the stranger you want him to be educated just to make more money this is education do you ever think like why were we born madame de staël said in life one must choose between boredom and suffering go to your room no im serious why were we born we were born because of adam and eve thats why now go upstairs and do your math algebra thats the most boring your other choice is suffering you want to start now move your ass jesus christ let me think you wake me up my heads all cobwebs wyczchuk wyczchuk waldemar wyczchuk you had lobster fra diavolo with him in atlantic city on the 14th of this month he got blown up fuck were not trying to pin this on soprano or anybody in your crew were drawing no conclusions but what do you got if i had coffee cut the quips tell me about the merger whats to say philadelphias put pressure on the shy business thats been going on since moses wore short pants tonys still resisting the philly overtures sometimes you dont act like a guy facing 30tolife for selling h dont get heavy with me you come here because somebodys leaning on you eight oclock am you come here you know what this looks like im doing all i can to help you guys one time tony bought a pool table from wyczchuk so he asks me if theres no god why was i born tells me hes got no purpose how did you answer that it costs 150000 to bring him up so if hes got no purpose i want a refund are you angry with him about the car you cant put shit back in the donkey boysll be boys its the other crap its not normal adolescent angst is very normal you never went through it you think my mother and father would stand for that how is your mother shes dead to me and hows anthony jr been taking it what about the family about your nonrelationship with his grandmother hows he supposed to understand that and in general the whole strain of the atmosphere in your house but that dont give him the right to mouth off sounds to me like anthony jr may have stumbled onto existentialism fucking internet no its a european philosophy after world war ii people were disillusioned by the sheer weight of the horrors thats when the whole idea took root that there were no absolute truths you believe that in your family even motherhoods up for debate i teach him to love and respect his mother what about your mother i think its important we talk about your mother and what she tried to do dont need to she showed her true colors thats all has anthony jr heard you say shes dead to me i dont know dont you think that kind of talk could lead him to embrace these ideas so now this is my fault no when some people first realize theyre solely responsible for their decisions actions and beliefs and that death lies at the end of every road they can be overcome with intense dread intense dread a dull aching anger that leads them to conclude that the only absolute truth is death i think the kids onto something ready to go okay pictures up lock up here we go theyre ready to roll stand by to roll quiet please roll sound we are rolling camera smoke out cameras rolling and action my leg i

is set in a world i want to do my next project in a picture on the life of crazy joe gallo they already did the gang that couldnt shoot straight but i see him as tragic a flawed and blinkered guy but he wanted to learn to grow to read to paint he had this yearning this hunger for fuck your mother whats the word you as joey gallo i dont see that but im part italian vince maybe vaughn this project happens to be a personal passion of mine i could play joey gallo but i dont want to act unless i can play myself which is understandable since amy mentioned you i thought we could work together you could tell me how shit goes down what makes sense what people really say but gallo i was only 3 when he got whacked but speech patterns you saw swingers whatever you think of it you can tell its important to me how people really talk like pucchiacca how can i forget that i grew up right in queens it is a long time ago you wouldnt be betraying any oath thing holy fucking shit that thing is still alive you believe that 15 years ago she was a piece of ass what what happened forget it come on its just us talking here a wiseguy friend of mine would kill me if he knew i told you this made

come on its fun yeah i know i just dont feel like it sometimes you gotta do things you dont want why because your parents say so and its tradition baseballs not my tradition hell it aint your dad in high school was almost allcounty left field but im not talking about that its about your confirmation i dont want to get confirmed why not dont matter why not youre looking for purpose doing whats right is your purpose not according to nietzsche who nietzsche let me tell you something nietzsche wound up talking to his horse and i know what youre gonna tell me sartre right well sartre was a fucking fraud he copped it all from husserl and heidegger go on you should start at the beginning take a look at kierkegaard whatever kierkegaard said every duty is essentially duty to god nigga be a leader not a follower what master p said that you still listen to rap why its just all about marketing now welcome to soho grand im here to see jon favreau one moment please who may i say is calling jerry from newark hes expecting me im sorry hes requested not to be disturbed tell him his 2 pm is waiting he has his telephone programmed so as to not be disturbed its 200 in the afternoon would you care to leave a message would you see if amy safirs in hey what are you doing here i was gonna meet jon about my script but the do not disturb sign is up shooting went very late we didnt wrap until 530 come on in i brought him jerseys best sangweech best in the world that was very nice you want it no thanks i brushed my teeth here have a seat want some coffee no i cant stay i got some business to take care of if they ever knew i was into this what im saying is this kind of thing is unacceptable where i come from you know if he read my script yet i have your script what jon asked me to read it dont take it personally its the process billy bob wrote something for jon and he had me read it first hello hey honey your cousins here thats right the screenwriter gregory says go fuck yourself union square cafe all right ill see you there so what did you think about what my script i love movies i started with dialogue but then you gotta find conflict and tell the story in picture arcs i think its got some real heart some good raw emotion in it you should try and finish it yeah i hit a fucking wall third act shit vicki king in 21 days to how to write a movie in says thats not uncommon these arent third act problems theyre in the second act get the fuck out see you ended right here in the middle of page 83 yeah this sentence could have gone either way when frankie says i dont know whether to shit or go blind hes at a crossroads he doesnt know but thats an expression right like a joke shit or go blind no because later on his father gets cancer of the eye whats it called glaucoma or whatever runs in the family they have to get him a guide dog oh but the third act starts at page 90 im not at the third act yet your inciting incident happens on page 12 it should be on 3 i knew that arc shit fucked me up i tried making it three dimensions here sit ill show you okay see i was thinking if you take the scene where rocco is fucking the two asian strippers thats a plot point i know but my question is whats at stake the jeopardys unclear what jeopardy theres a sevenpart hierarchy of human needs that explains and clarifies what drives us starting with the basic needs like food and water so you like my script its very good christopher you want me to tell you all seven seven what the human needs yeah survival yeah safety and security yeah the need to understand hi grandma grandma who is it you woke me its me anthony jr i didnt know i had a grandson i miss you yeah you should you never come see me ive been busy everybodys busy and dont lie to me i know your father forbids your coming down here he doesnt he just doesnt want us talking about you well he can go shit in his hat hes mad at me right now i shouldnt use that kind of talk dont let me ever catch you talking that way now what did you do bad my dad doesnt like my attitude so uncle pussy said i should come down and talk to you because youre old and have wisdom and stuff his mothers another one well what did you do i took moms car out and it got wrecked you ought to be ashamed of yourself was it bad uncle pussy already fixed it did you wear your safety belt yeah because there was an article in the paper the other day about a bunch of teenagers from out near the delaware water gap they overcrowded their car it hit a tree and it incinerated and they got trapped people could hear them screaming they couldnt get out the safety belts did it buckled them in see thats what i mean whats the purpose of what of being here on our planet the earth i mean those kids were dead meat whats the use whats the purpose why does everything have to have a purpose the world is a jungle and if you want my advice anthony dont expect happiness you wont get it people let you down and im not naming any names but in the end you die in your own arms you mean alone its all a big nothing what makes you think youre so special i guess i wont order us any espresso i took an acting class once oh yeah howd that go for you but i didnt need it oh yeah i figured out as far as movies ill be a player not an actor thats smart man like bugsy that was another thing that blew about swingers the acting know what was good acting hanks private ryan earn it its unfair to compare the two one is soldiers dying at normandy the other is guys looking for blowjobs in vegas yeah well you made the movie so listen you mind if i ask you something are you strapped right now strapped yeah fuck jesusfuckingchrist watch out man holy fuck can i ask you something else thats what im here for it will not leave this room i swear have you ever have i ever what come on you know no what im not gonna answer unless you ask no thats cool man im sorry you can ask me no thats cool oh come on come on rocky come on rocky ask me did i what have i ever what nothing man come on what just take it back this come on youre money i think the safetys off cut it out come on youre money here we go youre money did i ever what stop did i ever what just stop its not cool man i got dialogue tomorrow my voice gets scratchy its not cool so what did you think of my script well you know franky yeah i know franky hes my fucking leading man hes kind of like a contradictory character in a good way you know like complex should he wear the taps on his shoes i was gonna ask you they sound cool theyre his trademark but in the hit theyll hear him on the roof right thats a problem but what i was thinking was in this script in all scripts really it begs to show more of the author in it your life your vision the roof is soft tar thatll work the roof is soft tar okay and the father could go blind sooner and then he could smell the tar on frankys shoes and then he knows that his sons the killer holy fuck thats fucking great then hes gotta put one in his old mans head blam then another one blam fucking brilliant i spent all day with my friend picking out her bridesmaids dresses i havent found anything for the confirmation with all the

situation where everybody involved knows the stakes and if youre gonna accept those stakes you gotta do certain things its business were soldiers we follow codes orders so does that justify everything that you do excuse me when america opened the floodgates and let all us italians in what do you think they did it for because they were trying to save us from poverty it was because they needed us they needed us to build their cities and subways and to make them richer the carnegies and rockefellers needed worker bees there we were but some of us didnt want to lose who we were we wanted to preserve the important things honor and family and loyalty some of us wanted a piece of the action now we werent educated like the americans but we had the balls to take what we wanted and those other fucks those other the jp morgans they were crooks and killers too but that was the business right the american way that might all be true but what do poor italian immigrants have to do with you and

on the way to paradise how long you think we stay there now thats different for everybody you add up all your mortal sins and multiply that number by 50 then you add up all your venial sins and multiply that by 25 you add them together thats your sentence i figure i have to do about 6000 years before i get accepted into heaven and 6000 years is nothing in eternity terms i can do that standing on my head its like a couple of days here was i insensitive and perhaps did i do it deliberately do i hate him how often are you taking the ativan almost every night and when else sunday

when hes here hes got an uncle sick with cancer oh please they didnt speak for a year actually if you must know tony has been a little better weve been seeing his therapist together what hes no angelo stamfa thats all what is that supposed to mean you know angelo was dying to marry you and now stamfas is a chain of drugstores so what he doesnt need therapy he prescribes his own tranquilizers dont

on the phone ah i just wanted to make sure it was okay if i came alone i mean because tony couldnt make it i love the artwork you have out there those country scenes thank you that statue is not my favorite oh come on look its not lik e this when me and ton y are here together you never give him the silent treatment is that what you think im giving you the silent treatment maybe you could tell me why you came today im worried about my husband the mood swings i thought when his mother died maybe but still half the tim e he doesnt even talk to me youve seen him get like that that day he sat here like a wall i know that hes your patient and i am only the patients wife but you try living with that 24 hours a day seven days a week see how you feel i see oh you do well for your information i am not the only one the fact is tony isn t under the weather today he just didnt feel like coming fuck that shit i think he said okay usually happens when we touch on a nerve he was distressed about this young mans death in the garbage compactor see he didnt say garbage compactor did he see what is it you believe you know about his job he reports to a strip club who knows how he spends his days im sorry im just frustrated thats all tonys been out of sorts for so long and there is there is nothing i can do to help him i think coming to therapy with him has stirred up a lot of feelings in you

help i just needed to vent in case you change your mind heres the number of a colleague in livingston he was a teacher of mine that really wont be necessary but thank you anyway thank you for your

more a five f u based regimen with cisplatin and doxorubicin this is the treatment i would recommend are you getting this sort of so the chemotherapy would be instead of the surgery but i cant guarantee even that well have to evaluate the results of the treatment i could end up having the chemo puking my guts out having the six hairs i have left fall out and still have to be cut again im afraid thats a possibility you see with kennedy you dont get these maybes and possibilities yeah but you gott a have the surgery again dr kennedy is an excellent surgeon isnt there some way you people

told him you see having said that in this case after much deliberation we decided upon a suspended sentence this has been arrived at based on his academic performance and his involvement in sports his academic performance hes brought his gpa to a cminus what is the punishment we suggest and hope its meted out parentally so its not exactly zero tolerance each child is special thats a principle of this school well what about detention a lawsuit forced us to eliminate detention hes off the football team right no studies at harvard have shown that boys have success in avoiding pitfalls when they remain involved in sport you better wipe that smile off your face i told him hed be off the team you know now youre kind of undermining the its not only skill anthony has shown on the field its leadership as well we feel its against his interests to sever his relationship with the squad well if you think thats best however i cant say this strongly enough if there is one more infraction the sentence will go into effect and anthony will be expelled do you understand this anthony yes you completely sold us out in there whatd i do theyre not punishing him and you went along i suggested detention that was a charade so the football team can win the big game weve been waiting for years for him to get off the couch we should keep this in the family he aint getting off that easy overall

when im being cute ill let you know you liked jackie so you dont want to believe that he did this to himself so like a lot of other people you go around looking for boogie men to blame boogie men with italian names so whatever youre thinking you just stop thinking it right now because that is not what happened left left left stealing an exam thats quite a personal defeat isnt it it was wrong that

blueprint for total self discipline that would take you through your entire life and thats your only question why do guys in the army or like spies use that o thing when they tell time thatll be made abundantly clear to you for now we have an expression around here keep it simple capt delaunay please give mr soprano the standard t o i while i meet with his parents sir yes sir i for one think anthony could greatly benefit from our program which as i candidly told him is very rigorous do you mind i will be very frank with you major zwingli i do not agree with this hard nosed discipline the mother s seldom do wait till he starts opening doors foryou and pulling back your chair that would b e a miracle but thats not even something we thought we could hope for what about creativity tony independent thought i stressed rat her heavily with anthony the notions of duty and group think but i didnt for now mention to him the armys motto of today be an army of one why be an army at all how about a veterinarian isnt there enough war amputees horrible displaced jesus hes just gonna march around a little bit i wouldnt get too hung up on the marching aspect its part of it but its nothing compared to the mentoring that comes through small class size and faculty involvement in dorm life well that sounds wonderful certainly weve created too many options for our kids we cant blame the m for being confused then when things go wrong we fob them off onto the ever burgeoning for profit substance recovery industry this army of one thing what happens when each army of one decides fuck it i

something else fell through and then and then and then so shes regressing if she keeps it up shell be back in the womb over the course of a childs life theres a constant moving away and coming back security versus freedom but what i find interesting and thats if i hear you right is that at the age of 19 she actually wants to stay close to home well see thats what i was gonna say she did have someone close die jackie but she brings that up whenever you ask her to clean up after herself or whatever that shes traumatized he was shot to death yeah its tragic that kid it was some kind of drug deal you said exactly yeah yeah all the earmarks no its gotta be tough then again theyd been broken up and he wasnt nice to her it may be a manipulation in part shes got a hardon about columbia its so competitive but it doesnt mean that her pain over jackies death isnt real has she said to you or carmela shes depressed oh come on with that shit shes gonna be all right maybe she should be on medication and her anger is focused on carmela not on you i catch some shit but me and med we were always close even in that 15yearold period you know when she could hardly stomach carmela well you

notti its lovely fur president of the coalition of italian american antidefamation organizations okay this thing gets on my nerves dont get me started lets start with the idea of a parade for a genocidal colonial general a national holiday no less such festivities are deeply offensive to us these are broad charges all i know is italianamericans are extremely proud of christopher columbus admiral of the ocean seas and a great italian you know well of the compromise position we put forth now if you people wanna make it an italianpride parade we have no problem with that history does say columbus discovered america the america that put your people in bondage for three centuries but every culture has had to bear the pain in the making of what i think we can all agree is a startling economic miracle we cured polio i have to agree with phil the right to vote exactly take my grandparents two simple people from sicily who braved the perilous middle passage middle passage thats the

of aromatic asiago and supple barolo if they say spaghetti and meatballs you tell them orecchiette with broccoli raab if they say john gotti you tell them rudolph giuliani a princeton study showed that 74 percent of americans associated italianamericans with organized crime why would they do this because of the way the media depict us again it is our job to make sure people know the other side of italianamerican culture the educated wageearning lawabiding side because isnt that who we truly are thank you thank you professor murphy or should i call you professor longomurphy longo as you dont

new kind of slasher film it takes place in the world of you know the mafia its about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams anyway they call him the butcher and no they dont why the fuck not need i remind you of a certain butcher out of ac right not butcher go on jt so right hes kind of outshining his boss so the guy has him clipped but hes still alive when they cut him up hes gonna feel that the next day right so at the dump his body reassembles itself all except for a hand that got crushed so he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone especially the boss which is a pretty solid role right now its called pork store killer but im thinking just cleaver im confused you said hes dead hows he evening up with anybody hes a ghost as i understood a zombie of sorts great title by the way but if they jointed him hes not gonna end up all in the same dump hows that a slasher film what are you talkin about the slasher couple of kids naked in a lake certified maniac on the loose not a ghost actually the maniac is almost always a supernatural force freddy jason michael myers get the fuck out easy sil easy hes making a point michael myers is an escaped mental patient jason and freddy different kind of movie thats the kind were doing here saw the ring they made millions thats not including the godfather angle which we got here what if they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route then he would all end up in the same dump but hes a ghost i dont know ghostbusters another fucking money machine cavalrys here i brought

fuck down let me think mornings are better ill come up with a solution i dont want you to worry about it i must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day see youre tonys therapist whether its appropriate how can i help you its about my son well both kids really the situation with the shooting im very worried about them sure its a very serious problem you know guns in the home its a societal concern obviously we learned our lesson too late i removed all the firearms from the house after the goingson at tonys uncles anyway last night i was shrieking at my son and i said something i said something very cruel and especially since hes been trying so hard how are you doing you know im frazzled certainly but i am more worried about them theyre not kids any more when they were young there were certain things we could tell them about tonys life you know lies well just call them what they were but now so the issue isnt just guns in the home i think about my son in front of those cameras having to vouch for all of this my daughter and her friends they have to face all these years of facading they do or you do the minute i met tony i knew who that guy was on my second date he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a 200 power drill not the typical story of young love and i dont know if i loved him in spite of it or because of it my parents werent like that and i knew whether consciously or not i knew that behind that power drill there was probably some guy with a broken arm you know or worse and you coped with that how id go to my priest and i would cry and say how bad i felt about how my husband made his money but that was bullshit because there are far bigger crooks than my husband but the kids they dont decide who theyre born to so now what yeah thats just it now what its all out in the open now the whole thing and them theyre not in grade school any more they become the longer they stay with us complicit god putting aside the moral and legal issues clarity cant be a bad thing yes tonys second night in the coma i told him i loved him when was the last time i said that are you afraid you arent going to feel that way when he wakes

gives a shit about newark im making a point this neighborhood used to be beautiful hundred percent italian the 1920s most of them right off the boat most italians couldnt even find a church that wanted them so what did they do did they cry did they go to the government with their hand out no they took care of their own problems they said you dont want us here fine well build our own a better one look at all these buildings around here most of them are falling down into the ground but that church is still standing you know why the bricks cause our people give a shit thats why every sunday italians from the old neighborhood drive miles to come here to pray they keep this place alive so how come we never do buy land aj cause god aint making any more of it this is advice im imparting to you as your father now what are you afraid right like i havent seen places like this before see those houses over there im buying them those crappy ones what for for an investment what have i been

standpoint do the nuptials help us or hurt us if they do get married brings them closer obviously and by extension gets her closer to tony it could cause her to stop cooperating the guilt becomes overwhelming remember angel diletto i think its more likely to have the opposite effect his problems really become her problems if they have kids thats even more pressure the dilettos never had kids i wouldnt count on children shes had some issues female trouble maybe darwin was right nature really does weed out the nimrods so what do we do people yay or nay supportive or discouraging if anyone

you though the main thing about getting married i can never be called to testify what do you mean a wife cant testify against her husband right actually though i dont think thats actually true what do you mean they did a whole murder she wrote about that this butler thought his wife couldnt testify against her husband but it turns out legally she actually could to claim marital privilege three conditions must be met the communication must be made during the course of the marriage anything said before you were married is fair game two the communication must involve only the spouses the presence of a third party destroys the privilege three communication cant be made in furtherance of a crime oh my god its a simple question can they make me testify or not the short answer probably in organized crime a rico the feds will spend a fortune putting on their case believe me if they want you to testify theyre going to find a way here you go 10 percent apiece technically its a little less but our friend rounded you up to an even 60000 theres plenty more where that came from a lot of poor families need affordable housing in newark ronnie listen i didnt want to say this no hard feelings

you call me i gotta go mozzarella let me ask you a question you think ralphs a little weird about women i dont know ton i mean he beat one to death just for i forget what was it again maybe youre feeling guilty i dont see that why would i because hes a friend of yours and youre cuckolding him cuckolding is when a man has an affair with anothers wife shes not his wife anyway shes his cumare and therefore has no status whatever cumares have status i mean its not like in the old days when a man had a wife and then sort of a second wife used to be the men would take out their wives on fridays and their cumares on saturdays or maybe its the other way around anyway when i came up it wasnt so formal business associate of mines got two full families one up here one down in sea girt and his second wife busts his balls identical to the first sounds like a complicated arrangement im afraid our time is up just give me another minute i have a patient waiting well let him wait you make me wait out there all the time i just wanna ask you if its possible for a man to go out with a woman without really doing anything with them youll have to be more specific he likes them to hurt him and thats it and then he goes and he takes care of himself his own needs he sounds like a textbook masochist like s m the m part yes i thought all that stuff was just like a runup to the act thats the case for many people but not for people with paraphilias for them receiving pain being humiliated becomes in and of itself the sexual release like many other things we believe its rooted in childhood we can continue this next week just one more second i received regular beatings when i was a kid but im not going around looking for some woman to hook up jumper cables to my private parts its not a simple onetoone more than likely he had a controlling and punishing mother she loved him but showed it only in connection with some sort of violent or abusive act is everything about everybody really about their mothers all right back to the other thing for a guy like that hes going out with a woman he could technically not have penisary contact with her vulva it sounds like youre asking me for personal information i really cant give you good morning pickwick framing hello its so heartbreaking to hear those women talk about what they were going through and what they are going through the second woman joan her case is really not very unusual her husband was the financial planner she really did not have much involvement in the finances at the home what are your thoughts on that women tend to have the feeling that theyre not confident men tend to be overconfident actually in the financial area and women have to take responsibility and have to accept the fact that something like this we dont need no we dont need no thought control you have to have a contingency plan if your husband doesnt come home to take care of the finances you gotta get up ma you cant lie there day and night i wanna go home there is no more home ma we sold it you know that they keep making me eat all alone thats that cookie and minn i tried to be so nice i bought cookie a card from the gift shop

and want to help him with his heroin addiction any one of you been involved in an intervention before caught our daughter smoking pot once but not really no no problem an intervention is a nonjudgmental confrontation a carefrontation we call it now what i need from you guys is to make a list of specific times where christophers drug use impacted on you directly for example adriana is it you would say something like this christopher last monday you came home from work high and belligerent and you were physically abusive to me what if hes high when we try to talk to him then we wait till hes sober my first intervention steven patrano waited 10 hours for me to sober up your first intervention in 1997 i suffered a relapse as in heroin addiction alcoholics suffer a fairly high recidivism rate great so hes taking advice from a twotime loser there are no losers in recovery actually i never really met ralphs kid i saw him once from a distance though handsome boy hes got a long struggle ahead of him thats for sure doctors rehab physical therapy i think im going to have the medallions of veal you make me late for a table at tavern on the fucking green hows the real estate

youre projecting so youre not seeking an extracurricular outlet no i was just being theoretical what carmela did for me when i was hurt the way she took care of me nursed me back to health you think i wanna fucking betray that is it possible on some level you blame her for ajs problems look i dont know no carmelas a good mother she did her best look could you just give me some practical advice for once tell me what the fuck to do about my son well i think its entirely appropriate for you and carmela to tell aj you have certain expectations of him particularly since hes living in your home the most important thing is that you and carmela are in agreement on the issues that you dont undercut each other or act at crosspurposes here so you can buy a suit to look nice for job or college

boss went and sold the building he sold the building i got a kid in college where are my fucking eggs what the fuck is happening to this neighborhood  ladies and gentlemen corrado soprano is not some harmless old man being persecuted by the government but a ruthless and calculating mob boss who controls a vast criminal enterprise over the past few months youve heard from fbi agents who have documented clandestine meetings at his doctors offices tales of bidrigging sweetheart deals secret payoffs and even murder no corrado soprano is not some harmless old man but a killer who orders up murder like you and i order up coffee all right so i rewrote it the entire point of melvilles billy budd it seems to me is to show how mean humans can be to each other when living in cramped conditions whoa hold that thought come on in so how is your mothers apartment coming arties uncle zio finished the framing but now the sheetrock its wet on the bottom theres a leak maybe in the foundation my father is a contractor if you want i can have him take a look at it he is free i think tomorrow afternoon that would be a huge relief what smells in this house madonna its like the smell

when mr claggart gets mad at billy it is a surprise because he is always saying how handsome billy is this does not seem realistic because why would an officer care if a sailor was handsome or not hey

soprano came to visit me recently i bought him dinner we talked im not sure i like that he did that end run hes an oldfashioned guy pop very allegorical i dont think it was his intention to insult anybody you distracted me im taking a mulligan im afraid that maybe you backed yourself into a corner this hud thing your insistence on the 40 percent remember carmine from the beginning i thought 40 was a tad steep a real hardhead this soprano kid and the ego i tell you though when i first met him decisive as he is i would have been proud to call him my own son maybe theres a compromise here then theres always a compromise hes a bit of a poseur you ask me tony he likes to talk the talk i dont know what whatd he say his turf his appraiser son of a bitch what did they resod that green no you gotta give him some slack he hasnt really been boss of a family very long family i told you theyre a glorified crew whatever they are carmine the sopranos bring in a lot of cash ive been close with

billy budd a c he usually gets ds and fs whats with you today you okay he worked so hard on it why only a c i dont know did you like billy budd it was okay my teacher says its a gay book mr weggler that is ridiculous ive heard that before that was written in the 19th century i didnt know they had fags back then aj no offense im not gay youre not no i read where they found gay cavedrawings in africa really shut up this stuff is pervading our educational system not to mention movies tv shows what stuff this gay nonsense theyre teaching i am sorry but billy budd is not a homosexual book actually it is mother i saw the movie meadow with terence stamp he was in priscilla queen of the desert i dont know about that but billy budd is the story of an innocent sailor being picked on by an evil boss who is picking on him out of selfloathing caused by homosexual feelings in a military context oh please okay actually mrs soprano there is a passage where melville compares billy to a nude statue of adam really i thought you read it its a biblical reference does that make it gay whats the difference im saying its ridiculous how everything is being sold as homosexual must be a gay book billy budds the ships florist right leslie fiedler has written on gay themes in literature since the early 60s billy budd in particular well she doesnt know what shes talking about shes a he mother and hes lectured at columbia as a matter of fact well maybe hes gay you ever thought of that they broke the urn he sent little paulie to trash carmines restaurant he works for me what do i know a lot

jet ski and for us too though when we were piss poor this was the biggest caviar wish we could come up with kind of reminds you of the kennedy compound dont it can i ask you why theyre selling my husband said if we can get it well there is a buyer already in fact the house is sold but theres a chance that these buyers wont qualify for financing and i know the owner alan he lives just next door here hes an attorney if youre offering cash i thought you should at least see the place so its not really for sale its just as well because we couldnt swing this theres al the jury has claimed they are deadlocked however im inclined to agree with prosecution im going to give them additional time to reach a verdict we shouldve had a hung jury mistrial object for christs sake allen charge it has to play out ladies and gentlemen youve communicated that you feel that youre unable to come to a unanimous verdict in this case now i know that youve been at it for a while and it can be frustrating but weve all spent a lot of time on this trial and being as i have no reason to believe that another jury with the same evidence would be better able to reach a verdict im going to ask you to go back in there and reason with each other and apply the law and come back in here with a verdict if not i wanna move on here did somebody check the order make sure we got everything this time yes well keep me posted dinners served get any sleep couldnt we have absolutely no business getting into something like that house with aj two years away from college that was virginia lupo on the phone she hasnt heard from the owner i guess that deals gonna go through i wonder who they are motherfucking goddamn orangepeel beef call them up you got me plain soup right well be finished eating the rest before he gets back go through the order while theyre still here what good does that do hes still gotta get it and come back again what happened they left out part of the order call them up sit down and eat i

want to be outdoors forget that youre fined 3 for the fword i heard dad say motherf when i was coming down the stairs hes fined too were gonna make this policy work its too late whats going on you know it does seem like a good value even at that price waterfront property in that area we probably wouldnt get hurt as an investment youre the one that took real estate classes didnt you say that a person shouldnt look at a house as an investment i know you if you dont get the place youll sulk and ill be the wet blanket ill sulk i was sleeping if you want me to sign off we probably wouldnt lose money but if you dont want to go through with it believe me thats fine too but if you did virginia lupos phone number is on the bureau and you know better to act quickly if you know more is lost by indecision than by wrong decision thats all im saying hey jack lemmon hows lee remick so how the fuck are you that place help you yeah i found out about strengths i have i didnt even know i had you look fucking great thank you thank everybody for forcing me to deal with it especially adriana youre not shooting junk right fuck no im completely clean and sober which one of the 12 steps you on now

a couple of cases ill send flowers or cash in some cases wheres carmine at no change whatsoever where are you at i think a movement from below is not palatable to the other bosses its what they fear most a movement from outside its more forgivable and more understandable given the facts here i mean youve been reasonable if i do it what do you do for me i take a sad song and make it better with the other families as regards you youre smart to have reservations but theres differences between this and castellano yes you still got the four other families who could raise a stink but andys my brotherinlaw i have their ear im gonna pass fuck are you talking about im taking the risk fuck what were you talking about last time then what would it take fuck even one percentage point all claims

if his fucking speech is affected poor bastard when youre up at the house who comes to visit anybody mostly rosalie aprile sils wife who calls on the phone most of the calls seem to be for anthony so look the real reason im here is to confront you in a positive way about taking our relationship in that other direction why did you have to be underhanded i dont find that appealing frankly i was gonna ask you out for coffee or something but i didnt think youd go ill pay for the hour that goes without saying forget that i was listening to that guy on tv dr phil and he was talking about a similar situation and he said that you could if you wanted to theres no set rules its basically about malpractice and you probably couldnt get sued thats not the point look i was thinking about all kinds of moves buy her a piece of jewelry pay the guy to close down the restaurant where she eats lunch and hire a mandolin player this is the place where weve been most honest with each other and thats the way i always liked it so that being said if you dont like me personally or the cut of my jib or my face or whatever then the matter will end here and i will never ask you again you can be honest i like you anthony and no you have a very nice face working on the weight too good explain to me okay why this is a matter of such importance to you there must be plenty of women out there

unpracticed in not getting what he wants and now since the therapy is kaput what use are you to him except for sex thank you elliot your depth of feeling is really quite extraordinary here all you could come up with was this weak borscht about professional ethics because you are worried about how this thug will handle rejection you know at first i did find him a little sexy dangerous alpha male but as year followed year the ugliness i saw i heard you kept him a long time though theres a mutual sympathy there of some kind i guess maybe its just the italian thing sil said you were looking for

stuff but he died alone with nothing and nobody good prick i hated it you supply the war ill supply the headlines how conceited there was the cinematography yeah that was very good oh my god what i saw laura basi in the dressing room at loehmanns definitely had some work d cup at least and a lift well she said she was remodeling her upstairs but i had no idea so carm how you doing im okay my lawyer hes a top guy robert greenberg he says that new jersey has this equitable distribution law so apparently 20 years entitles me to at least half his money well it should you made tony a home you raised his children does this guy know how to get it well its mostly cash obviously god all those years and you could get nothing this other lawyer dan minditch says that we should play hardball you

massarone aw jesus christ if he flipped id be fucked we all would well he aint been to the grand jury because we would have heard from our girl up there they could be just following him at this point

wouldnt there or the right midsternum are you a physician no im a preboard certified massage therapist so did she have any of those kind of things actually yes on the right clavicle and the sternum

you wait im gonna kick your fuckin ass whats wrong with right now then huh whats wrong with right now come on blah now you got nothin thank you mary youre welcome i hated to call you in but i got this midterm report from mr fiske anthonys english teacher and uh well it doesnt hit the mail for a few days and i thought maybe we could get a jump on it and avert any real crisis wonderful another crisis hes still well below the c average he needs for the colleges we discussed there is also an issue with his five paragraph essay animal farm anthony submitted his oneline topic late then two drafts the first was apparently sketchy the second fiske said was suspiciously cogent plagiarism he thinks my son cheated he spent almost an entire saturday afternoon at the library i think its obvious whats going on what do you mean anyone else shows sudden improvement he gets a gold star my son gets his act together and suddenly hes a cheater i know what people think bob italianamerican father in the carting industry are you suggesting some sort of bias because thats a very serious charge i have met this mr fiske hes a cold fish couldnt you or one of the other teachers talk to him tell him how hard ajs trying nothing will make a better argument than continued effort on ajs part but hey there theres still a shot this semesters grade is heavily weighted on their term paper on lord of the flies my stomach is in knots thats why i thought it important that you come in though it did take me about an hour to decide what to wear me too does that mean youve thought about my dinner offer i probably shouldnt say this but i have thought about nothing else since you called well we cant do justice to any discussion of madame bovary over the phone thats the thing though that book was way over my head why would you even be interested in someone like me because of just that i mean who admits this stuff not only are you very attractive youre unpretentious you say whats on your mind so a big mouth i see how that would attract a man like you so should we grab a meal or not well there are other things to think about my husband for one your husbands gonna have to get used to the idea that your life is moving on im not worried about my life oh you know what call me naive but in this day and age i dont really think your husband if he found out is going to break his sons teachers legs not to mention how that would play in the admissions office at arizona state i dont get it whats so funny about that honey arent you gonna eat something janice made lasagna its not so great but you need something on your stomach were gonna go got to stop at my mothers gwen just told us how you met they let you use the internet in the can they let you post an ad i got to read some of that shit i bet its hysterical hes uh trying to concentrate vascular physiology neurotomy shit t made it out like it was a big gym test some people dont realize what massage involves im practically doin two years of medical school on my own right now one thing i learned in recovery other peoples definitions of you sometimes theyre more about makin themselves feel better you got to define yourself keep your eye on the tiger man see you tony bye i suppose i could speak with monsignor bava have him call his nephew at kmart thatll fix us in the huggies department well the diaper drive covers clothe the naked what do you say we work on feed the hungry this looks delicious thanks for inviting me carm pleasant surprise indeed so how goes life these days actually i think i met somebody really just kind of happened we had been working on this project together and suddenly we both realized that there were certain feelings and i like him as a person too of course dont get me wrong the funny thing is i was sure he was gay he sort of reminded me of you hes an intellectual you know what i mean anyway we had been friends i guess and then he called to ask me out and suddenly all the formality dropped away when i saw him the other day he looked at me with this intensity now i know its wrong but the truth is i feel it too you know if you really want to discuss this i think we should include tony in the conversation as well why are you sounding i dont know kind of hostile im not perhaps thats your sin talking this is none of tonys business who knows what hes been up to and not just during the separation either that doesnt change the fact you made a commitment to each other before god maybe you should send the papal nuncio to tony and remind him of that why am i the only one held to any kind of standards and for that matter if this is wrong why did god put this man in my life is it god that put him there or is there a particular need you have right now see i never understand this didnt he put the need there say when seor you office 515 i havent punched in yet this is still my time yeah i give you a hard time about my truck the other day cops find two kids feel free to apologize any time anyway they investigate could be joyride but i think maybe behind it is my cousin in the north side you know if they found my books who knows you study hard for massage yeah the licensing test is pretty hard huge failure rate if you pass then what you do with this be a professional masseur you no think of massage kageh you know small sauna yeah i could see it four or five

call me late the next morning and he sent flowers but other than that i havent heard from him all week what did he say that it was nice you know and it was nice he was very sweet actually so you think

good well thats him you two should talk let me just pee okay so was your father in a rush now or something i dont know he said he was tired to give you this and a kiss on the cheek thank god its the last thing i needed was to talk to him know who loved golf it was joey peeps may he rest in peace its sad when they go young like that when they go come on huh it was little carmine behind it payback for that whore he was fucking lorraine calluzo you dont know that for sure john little carmine knew how fond i was of this kid tony i picked him out of the chorus schooled him those years he was my driver anything from your cop some homeless fuck saw a guy limping away and then he wasnt sure ill tell you i dont know how im gonna get through joeys funeral and forget about ginny every christmas

some electrolytes in him we got you come on buddy come on thats it sit down good good thats it thats it youre all right youre all right the point i am trying to illustrate is that of course no one wants allout conflict but historically historical changes have come out of war far as im concerned its a new day all old treaties and ways of doing things are null and void exactly and the joe peeps thing where does that leave us when youve had a quadruple bypass like i did it gives you a lot of time to think the only thing johnny understands is force but the fact is though we pissed on a bees nest so whats the other option rollover we couldve had a sitdown the other captains maybe this isnt the un angelo i wont let what happened to my father happen to me god forgive me but you may be a stronger man than your dad was the fundamental question is will i be as effective as a boss like my dad was and i will be even more so but until i am its gonna be hard to verify that i think ill be more effective i just talked to my parents they offered me a jetblue ticket home no economic relief what did the lady at student placement say i never went down there why didnt you this economy hello i mean even the crappiest mcjobs arent there besides i wouldnt wanna take away a job a minority could have just it doesnt cool anything anyway leave it dont open the window the garbage reeks why do we

home and live with my parents i graduated i mean maybe i should go back out i can work as a pa for joshs dad at least id earn some cash you could come out for a week wait wait what hes a photographer i told you he does major magazine ads bmw its pretty cool stuff is that what you want no but at least id have money your thing with models theres no models what its interesting work as a career

year you bitch every time were at a party and i ask you to take a snap of me and my friends look im just saying i gave up junior year abroad so we could be together i know and i wanna stay here i

the reason i called i gave your secretary the broad strokes youre in the middle of a separation the original attorney retired right bob greenberg at any rate im thinking its time i move forward with the divorce proceedings mrs soprano im afraid im gonna have to cut you short as far as handling it im afraid i have to recuse myself what do you mean why actually your husband had been in to see me for a consultation last year my husband hired you no but based on a prior meeting the code of professional responsibility precludes me from representing you because of that consultation but he met with greenberg too and he was willing to represent me mr greenberg wouldve found himself in some ethical soup had he moved forward i dont understand this why is my husband so picky he talked to seven or eight of the top divorce attorneys in new jersey well you can probably figure that maneuver out for yourself jesus christ i understand your frustration if you like i can recommend a colleague someone your husband hasnt contaminated well yeah okay according to johnny sack kids brains were splattered all over the seat joe peeps couldnt have been too much to clean up i heard the hooker he was with got it in the chest must have been silicone everywheres too why you always try and top me you took the air right out of my whole fucking punch line asshole anyway joey peeps moms a widow shes in a wheelchair johnnys taking care of the internment that shit there im thinking we should pick up the headstone jason get into it ill call the marble guy whats up guys frankie frankie talk to you outside give me two whats up turns out somebody got a look at the guy that did joe peeps all they got so far is hes got a bad limp ahh long john silver maybe where the fuck do you get the balls i am bending over backwards trying to stay neutral paying for fucking car seats and youre out there acting like a fucking freeagent and dont look at me like im a fucking jerkoff im sick of you leaning on this cousin thing and that bad hijack like you can do whatever the fuck it is you wanna do because you went away that night and i didnt youre the one who keeps bringing that up im fine with it first of all for the record i had nothing to do with this dont fucking lie to me even if i was would you really wanna know that would just be another problem for you with johnny right all right look i know youre not earning what you expected and you got the twins and nancy youre a capable guy your mother let it slip one time you got an iq of 158 she told you that it was the week you got tested all the fucking nuns were raving about it lot of good it did me i had high hopes when you got out yeah look a guy like you brains balls if youd fucking be straight with me i could use all that put me in coach all right we got the casino on bloomfield avenue above the hardware store carlos guy was running it but he just got diagnosed with the hodgkins thats mine yeah a lot of fucking money there and ill see what i can do about getting you straightened out opening up the books for you its long overdue so i solved a major problem businesswise put a very good piece of manpower to work my cousin tony you mentioned how close you two are when we were kids they called me tony uncle johnny and theyd call him tony uncle al right yes you told me all that anyway hes a very smart guy hes got an iq of 158 do you put a lot of stock into that number why are you gonna tell me its bullshit because i took that test and somebody gets a 158 well they know a few things so we can assume you think hes smarter than you honestly i think hes smarter than you the way you keep shitting on the test but im no gabbadotz myself this was a good move carmela and i slept together what was that like it was nice it was very erotic she was wearing that perfume that she wears poor thing was starved for it honestly im the only man shes ever been with did you discuss it no i left before she woke up how come because if she woke up and i was there it would send mixed signals you know im not sure thats the best yeah no tell him i got fax machines coming out of my ass and would you characterize the separation thus far as amicable ahh its barely civil yeah there are moments when old habits kick in and you know feelings but he is definitely not the person i wanna spend the rest of my life with fair enough as for the assets youve given me your tax returns and investments here the house is in my name not the boat thats the stugots is it yes im a little concerned that the returns dont really reflect everything there is other income theres a lot more unreported income yes and this other income is it from an illegal stream no of course not but he does deal in cash my husband the carting business i see is that a problem i handled a case once where the husband owned vending machines i used a forensic accountant to reconstruct his finances in less than a week he outlined 11 years of income and were talking coins hey you busy day i dropped off application at the cineplex on broadway stopped by my dads looks like he got you a job working construction construction thats awesome its in jersey though so

him at the club can we just stop fighting you got out a suitcase ill put it back okay now batting for the padres so its not about us but suddenly youre talking about options dont paraphrase what i said i said this point in our lives is a transition period forced on us by external events school is over for me and next year for you these are difficult choices what youd rather not have choices thank god for choices oh stop your bullshit its really simple are we going to stay together or not if you want thats not what i asked i said i did and then you said how are we gonna keep it together through four years of dental school for you and probably med school for me well its a good question but why ask it now tonight of all times are you asleep no you were and now youre gonna lie like you did about the suitcase i did not lie about the suitcase oh then what do you call it i dont know i explained it jesus you should quit the law center youre like a prosecutor at 4 in the morning i cant think how can you sleep when were in the middle of this in the middle of what all i said was i didnt wanna go back to the job site and maybe i should go home until this thing with vito blows over but you didnt ask me to come you went right to the closet and got out your suitcase jesus christ look just stop crying okay why dont we just get married married lets get engaged really why are you saying that now i cant think its too late its just something i feel very strongly i was wondering when i was gonna hear from you never got your statement well actually thats why i called we hit a bit of a snag what kind of snag well i put a call in to phil canter a few days ago the forensic accountant the one with the vending machines but then i didnt hear back from him suddenly he called and said he wasnt interested so i called another accountant and frankly when he heard your husband was the defendant he demurred as well so what does this mean you dont want the case well as my partners reminded me i do have a full caseload already i probably shouldve mentioned and you were feeling so positive i woke up this morning the depression just washed over me you are dissolving a 20year marriage its not my fucking goddamn marriage okay i had another panic attack and i thought i had this shit beat what happened playing golf with a friend of mine and he was talking about this young guy he knew who

the attacks first reappeared what was going on in your life you had just rebuffed my affections when you actually passed out were you thinking about me or i walked into my house and the cleaning girl was crying on the phone about her cousin who went off the road in a mexican bus wreck or something and i remember just feeling inside like i wanted to fucking choke her because it was always something

not his foot forget the foot i worry about him hes hes right out of fucking jail okay all right look the reason he went to prison is he got pinched hijacking a truckload of betamaxes in 86 and they

i drag here gotta be a dead dog i went to see my sons football coach see he was starting my boy now coach is going to this other kid whats the reason well ajs just devoting more energy to academics he wants to get into a good school hows things on other fronts your cousin well you touched on something there thats not so good whats the problem i really cant talk to you about it this is very difficult for me treating you when so much of your life is closed off how many times can i say this look im not trying to be difficult here it affects me tremendously this trouble hes gotten himself into so im upset well and i care about him so much you care about him so much we spent hours getting to the realization that your feelings for your cousin stem from guilt and shame do you remember that do you care its just that it doesnt matter now its just that here we are as always back at square one with you going into high sentimentality mode sentimentality mode we were children together look its a lot like with your son heres what i bet the coach didnt tell you what you wanted to hear most is that your son is special too what im saying is whatever you wanna do visvis your cousin your

his age are getting blown up in iraq you know something thats interesting janice noticed that when aj talks about tonys possibly not coming out of this he cant even use the word dad he says anthony soprano is not going to die well thats a fascinating psychological nugget but it dont change the fact that if that kid dont pull his end in this hes never going to forgive himself and nobody else should either its just that tony has always loomed so large for aj well maybe its just that aj is a selfish boy who doesnt give a shit im sorry your son is no longer with us but dont use mine as a guinea pig for your ideas on parenting i never saw you take a hard line why do you think im talking to you like this the thing is tony has an open incision if you are there in the room and they change

call them jt youre on well weve been working on a new kind of slasher film it takes place in the world of you know the mafia its about a wiseguy with a big mouth and bigger dreams anyway they call him the butcher and no they dont why the fuck not need i remind you of a certain butcher out of ac right not butcher go on jt so right hes kind of outshining his boss so the guy has him clipped but hes still alive when they cut him up hes gonna feel that the next day right so at the dump his body reassembles itself all except for a hand that got crushed so he ties a cleaver onto the stump and he goes out to get revenge on everyone especially the boss which is a pretty solid role right now its called pork store killer but im thinking just cleaver im confused you said hes dead hows he evening up with anybody hes a ghost as i understood a zombie of sorts great title by the way but if they jointed him hes not gonna end up all in the same dump hows that a slasher film what are you talkin about the slasher couple of kids naked in a lake certified maniac on the loose not a ghost actually the maniac is almost always a supernatural force freddy jason michael myers get the fuck out easy sil easy hes making a point michael myers is an escaped mental patient jason and freddy different kind of movie thats the kind were doing here saw the ring they made millions thats not including the godfather angle which we got here what if they disposed him at stops that happened to be along the same route then he would all end up in the same dump but hes a ghost i dont know ghostbusters another

anthony soprano junior himself told our amy kean growing up soprano its just plain weird you just wanna bite it big lots whats your deal today carmela i swear ill fucking kill you what the fuck you made a fool of yourself and our family on national fucking television i didnt even say that shit they totally misquoted me holy shit well of course they did thats what they do which is why i and

two kids in private school this arrangement with vito is killing me its 930 at night bobby i dont remember what the fuck it was roseville this temporary shit i need an answer already im going out of my fucking mind im liable to do something drastic calm the fuck down let me think mornings are better ill come up with a solution i dont want you to worry about it i must have sounded odd at the supermarket the other day see youre tonys therapist whether its appropriate how can i help you its about my son well both kids really the situation with the shooting im very worried about them sure its a very serious problem you know guns in the home its a societal concern obviously we learned our lesson too late i removed all the firearms from the house after the goingson at tonys uncles anyway last night i was shrieking at my son and i said something i said something very cruel and especially since hes been trying so hard how are you doing you know im frazzled certainly but i am more worried about them theyre not kids any more when they were young there were certain things we could tell them about tonys life you know lies well just call them what they were but now so the issue isnt just guns in the home i think about my son in front of those cameras having to vouch for all of this my daughter and her friends they have to face all these years of facading they do or you do the minute i met tony i knew who that guy was on my second date he brought me and my mother each a dozen roses and my father a 200 power drill not the typical story of young love and i dont know if i loved him in spite of it or because of it my parents werent like that and i knew whether consciously or not i knew that behind that power drill there was probably some guy with a broken arm you know or worse and you coped with that how id go to my priest and i would cry and say how bad i felt about how my husband made his money but that was bullshit because there are far bigger crooks than my husband but the kids they dont decide who theyre born to so now what yeah thats just it now what its all out in the open now the whole thing and them theyre not in grade school any more they become the longer they stay with us complicit god putting aside the moral and legal issues clarity cant be a bad thing yes tonys second night in the coma i told him i loved him when was the last time i said that are you afraid you arent going to feel that way when he wakes up anthony tells me things have been better between you cant breathe its ok honey youre gonna be ok i cant breathe its all right cant

brought you something born again charles colson the watergate guy friend of mine did time with him a ruthless powerful man who thought he was above the law he committed crimes and then went to prison and then he found jesus and everything changed became a different man yeah so salvation isnt just about being saved from hell after you die its also about being saved from yourself while youre still alive i hope when you get out of the hospital that youll join us at the church of the open door of the redeemer well it must be nice to have something to hold onto maybe hmm what dinosaurs my kids cant get enough yeah yeah me too every since i saw king kong kick their ass in the original my son loves dinosaurs too thats interesting what some people would have you believe dinosaurs existed millions of years ago its just not true god created the earth 6000 years ago and i tell my kids you have to remember dinosaurs and human beings lived on the earth at the same time what like the flintstones its in the bible yeah but what about all that carbondating stuff a lot of scientists would disagree with you well i think youll find all those people have an agenda tony evolution which is satans plan to deny god evolution and salvation are mutually exclusive guy next doors a scientist think hed disagree with you big time then that mans not saved read about mr colson well talk later whats he saying there were dinosaurs back with adam and eve i guess no way t rex in the garden of eden adam and eve would be running all the time scared shitless but the bible says it was paradise you

something and i dont wanna go back and my wife told me i woke up at one point and said who am i where am i going kinda makes you wonder about heaven and hell that presupposes a duality of good and

father jose im mr gaultieri wheres father felix unfortunately hes ill hes having bypass surgery he asked me to fill in you know mr russamano from the neighborhood association sure paulie chuck how you feeling he was an altar boy ahh so the feast of st elzear father felix brought me up to speed id like to hear your ideas for this year well there aint much to talk about its all done through our nonprofit corporation we close the streets for five days hire the food vendors rides et cetera day two we start the procession push the statue up and down the block you say a couple of prayers and thats that alls said and done you get your end about that as i was telling mr russamano frankly 10000 struck me as quite low it is what it is look im new here i certainly dont wanna rock the boat i realize there are certain neighborhood traditions its just that given the current costs we feel an increase is long overdue what kind of increase we feel 50000 would be a more equitable donation 50 just this year we started a soup kitchen for the homeless a reading program for bilingual children theres less help than ever from the federal government you think this feast pays for itself security electric sanitation not to mention fuel costs yeah the way it seems to break down is you spend 18 for a city permit to close down the street charge fees to the vendors in the thousands of dollars to lease out land that you dont even own yeah well it seems to me the church has plenty in its coffers for all those pedophilia lawsuits the parishs deal was negotiated since this was johnny sopranos feast these are different times mr gaultieri well some things dont change couple of days joe vella from the honor guard will be by with the float transfer the statue from his niche pick up the hat and other stuff you say things dont change this feast was started over 100 years ago in a spirit of giving italian immigrants the working poor gave what little money they had to honor st elzear hes the patron saint from my grandparents town ariano di puglia many of those folks gave their gold wedding bands which were melted down to make the saints hat yeah the holy society of st elzear of which you are recording secretary has for the past 100 years entrusted us with the care of that habiliment frankly i dont feel safe giving it over this year we use it every year its part of the tradition i understand but im sorry given the tenor of this conversation i sense theres a possible criminal element in this neighborhood that could endanger this precious piece of local history but for 50 grand you wouldnt have that sense it would demonstrate to me that you take this feast as seriously as the people who began it okay father nice meeting you fuck the hat its fucking bullshit i got a fax from

here generation after generation hundreds and hundreds of years all those lives god its so sad i mean it isnt sad i dont know it just makes you think just makes you look at yourself differently there was this one night in the hospital when it was very touchandgo with tony mmhmm he came out of the coma for a minute and he said who am i where am i going at the time i didnt know what he meant but coming here i feel the same way isnt that odd let me get a picture oh honey what we worry so much sometimes it feels like thats all we do but in the end it just gets washed away all of it just just gets washed away come here oh i know what the papers are saying but the police think it mightve not have been a gay thing marie honey they pick up strangers in bars and truck stops the way they beat him oh god his face he didnt even look like a person anymore you cant let your mind dwell on turn that off aunt cel hasnt called not even to talk to the kids how could people be so cruel it is a sin after all marie the church is very clear on that but youre here you came father always says hate the sin love the sinner i wish i was dead i mean it i wish i was dead you know what ill make the funeral arrangements youre in no condition given the circumstances a small private service just the immediate family he was a good man wasnt he phil he was i loved him like a brotherinlaw but god moves in strange ways our tailor hes going blind 47 years old walk in those shoes and i gotta think marie vito on some level maybe its better for the kids not to have that role model so all the women in your house are gone how do you feel about carmela taking a trip without you do we really have to fucking talk about this of course not before we end is there anything youd like to discuss okay how about the fact that i hate my son i come home and hes sitting on the computer in his fucking underwear wasting his time in some chitchat room going back and forth with some other fucking jerkoff giggling like a little schoolgirl i want to fucking smash his fucking face in my son what do you think about that anthony i think your anger towards aj has been building for some time we have to deal with this all i know is its a good thing my fathers not alive because hed find this fucking hilarious find what hilarious the kind of son i produced you mean because anthony doesnt conform to your fathers idea of what a man should be his mine or anybodys let me tell you if carmela let me kick ajs ass like my father kicked my ass he might have grown up with some balls like you yeah like me he might have also grown up taking out his anger at his fathers brutality towards him on others he might have grown up with a desperate need to dominate and control anthony weve been dancing around this for years how you live what is it you want from your life i couldnt even hit him if i wanted to hes so fucking little its carmelas side of the family theyre small people her father you could knock him over with a fucking feather okay but i have to point out what you resent carmela doing for aj protecting him from his father is the very thing you had often wished your mother had done for you i love

go for coffee well okay wanna follow me to that dive on sip and jfk for some people depression is a form of forced introversion and in lincolns case it was extremely painful but its out of that forced introversion that comes the abraham lincoln where you been linda merolas whos the successful president i left you a message the annual christmas toy drive how was it it was nice we gave an xbox so stan klimik was there ruths husband he works for kroll the private eyes he does their computers anyway i was telling him about ade and he said we should hire professionals to track her down carm its not as expensive as you might think tony he gave me his card look its not about the money did you ever think that maybe its an intrusion into ades personal life but what if shes in trouble tony stan said they had this case once this guy ran out on his child support he was a hiking enthusiast missing 12 years and they tracked him down to a watering station in the mojave desert carmelas spec house i need you to go lean on that building inspector leave it alone you said do it today for all our sakes my wife needs a career tony hey seasons greetings good holidays to your family huh yeah you too

are you sure about the title cleaver the jerry mathers connection rules of success for pictures like this oneword titles saw hostel cleaver but michael he knows its the boss right away you might want to make more of a mystery out of it maybe this boss hes a really rough is anthony soprano like that hes just a jumpingoff point for the character hes got some similarness like he thinks everythings his but its not i cant get into it but there are some rules thank you dont get into it i dont wanna know its just weird you know being where hes been he hasnt been anywhere nothing happened i told you that dont matter hes been there in his mind ugh fine youre right guys got a lot more on his mind than this like whether or not to have that third sandwich im not a fucking parking spot ow dont get me wrong i loved dom more than anybody my point is we dont know if tony was behind this it was payback for vito so why the fuck did they blow up the wire room the balls on this prick to blow up a store you call that balls balls is you look a guy in the eye while you jam an ice pick through his lung i meant balls as in nerve gall i know what the fuck you meant far as im concerned this is like 911

despite appearances were joined now from bainbridge lsland washington by jerrys fellow mob expert manny safier the author of the new book the wise guide to wise guys welcome to the programme how goes the book tour thank you geraldo excellent jerry how are you manny were discussing the apparent mob power vacuum here in new york city are you shocked that theres still no successor to john sacrimoni not really i mean the last ten 1 2 years thats been a dysfunctional family and as jerry said earlier there are several viable candidates viable i don t know you had phil leotardo as the logical successor you also have gerardo gerry torciano also faustino doc santoro who i believe is the front runner im surprised you haven t mentioned carmine lupertazzi jr i was about to before you interrupted in fact if you take a look at my book in chapter 1 4 this santoro thing i called it a year ago hey thank you for coming anthony i know its a long trip and miss a chance to see missouri so hows ginny today she went to buy some stuff for the kitchenette good clear her mind reason i asked you here today shes a bright kid your sister but business my life insurance i want to put her on a monthly stipend probably a good idea not all the doctors agree but if i do only have a few months i wanna take care of all this now wait a second which doctor doesnt agree feldman the guy i told you about the wifemurderer hes still a doctor he was a highly respected oncologist i know but john he reviewed my case he says i could hang on for years youre right he still has the knowledge ojs no less of a running back right let me ask you something anthony how will i be remembered a wonderful husband a loving father on the street though i mean from what i know you were wellliked respected across the board despite the allocution god knows guys have actually named names for a lot less than what you were looking at the only nega what when carmine died and you took over people felt you changed became a little triggerhappy maybe a hothead god forbid any of them would find themselves in that position its a thankless job what are you hung over what i had two glasses of wine why are you so pissy portrayal of that guy in the movie what guy the boss tony what about him it was based on you i know you said the yelling it wasnt just the yelling imitations a form of flattery you think that was flattering it was ok hes a tough prick that baldwin what about the girlfriend what girlfriend the cleaver guy the lead character his entire motive for revenge i dont know you lost me carm sally boy the boss he fucked the guys fiance the thing with adriana i told you it never fucking happened apparently your nephew feels otherwise ro pointed it out to me if she saw it other people did its a movie its fictional its a revenge fantasy tony which ends with the bosss head split open by a meat cleaver there he is good time last night yeah it was all right how about you gab had fucking nightmares club soda hon sure so what did you think of the movie chrissys the last person i would have confused with marty but i gotta say it wasnt bad is he around chrissy nah he dont come around here no more that baldwin was pretty good huh he was a mean fuck ill give him that and that girl that played the fiance she was hot the one he was fucking its weird how it works the creative process im watching edward scissorhands when boom all of a sudden it hits me what if instead of a pair of scissors its a meat cleaver instead a couple years later you got a movie originally i thought a

took a rest i say im gonna well take a vacation she says thats not what i meant l dont wanna be the wealthiest widow on long lsland l want you to quit now im not ashamed to say that she made me cry that wonderful loving woman that dream with my father the empty box it wasnt about being boss it was about being happy warren hi hi hon hows he doing listen ive been meaning to talk to you about the smoking john shared with me how upset you were psychologically when a persons told theyre dying its the ultimate loss of control to hear him wheeze like that i know it doesnt make any sense i do know hes a leader i suspect his smoking on some level is an attempt to die as he lived in total control years ago i asked him to stop for me and the kids i lost 27 lbs he couldnt quit smoking i gotta go goodbye caitlin ill see you soon muffin oh my god i love these little hands thanks so much for watching her youd think were planning a coronation not a christening we all set you know what id better pee goody i get to keep holding you so how you doing tony said you got an offer on a house you built two actually yes ivana trump i gotta be honest i am very disappointed at what you did what are you talking about your movie the boss sleeping with the other guys fiance what like it wasnt based on tony and ade what no carmela i didnt even write it story by christopher moltisanti lsnt that what it said on the screen thats just for the writers guild health insurance oh really come on you cant be serious shes an oriental for christs sake have you heard from ade lately no why would i hear from her would it be so surprising she left me for some other guy is it any wonder her poor mother is so upset shes practically delusional shes convinced herself that ade is dead her mothers an alkie you know that regardless christopher youre my cousin and i love you carmela but i dont like what youre inferring either with the movie or with how i treated adriana kelli comes out tell her i went to smoke theres my pal how you doing billy bathgate they had it in the library i thought of you i dont know if you heard but gerry torciano he was hit last week in brooklyn who gerry torciano it was all over the news they whacked him in some restaurant did you know him yeah i dont know good guy its hard to breathe ill talk to gupte see if i can get him to up the beclovent im dying arent l its not good i wont lie to you the aggressiveness surprises me i gotta concur with rosen i appreciate everything youve done warren who is it you dont answer your phone i shut the ringer its the middle of the night honey whats wrong nothing sweetie its fine go back to sleep it aint fine we got a problem that sequence with sally boy banging the fiance you gotta tell tony that was your idea it wasnt my idea what are you fucking stupid he probably thinks i put it in to embarrass him why did you put it in there it was an idea i dont know who knows where they come from newton invented gravity cos some asshole hit him with an apple its bad enough that i dont get credit for my ideas i must take responsibility for some shit thats gonna get me in trouble fuck that man humanitis award whats that humanitas from the paulist brothers for writing socially redeeming look out the window you see a fucking hollywood sign out there maybe you talk to your agent like that but dont ever get snippy on me again the scary thing was i didnt know what happened till after the shot was fired fucking weird tony hey gentlemen hey how are you tj hooker jt actually but im looking for chris im supposed to meet him what here the thing is he left me a message but this fucking verizon mind if i wait yeah sit down diet coke please you got it so what did you think of cleaver its good you know congratulations i hope were gonna see some money soon yeah as a writer you can never tell you come up with an idea you dont know how the audience will respond i mean just cos i like something i think of doesnt mean anyone else will thats the challenge it is challenging sometimes inventing characters how they interact the boss sally boy for example his whole persona i stole that from broderick crawford in born yesterday whats that garson kanin 1 950 its terrific william holden falls in love with crawfords girlfriend played by judy holliday the black girl the singer no thats billie holiday although judys character in the movie is named billie too so i see why youre confused ive never seen it why would i be confused anyway the sally boy character is based on crawford sort of a big burly guy the love triangle the cuckolding of michael sleeping with the fiance very similar to the holdenholliday dynamic so the whole thing was your idea with apologies to garson kanin what happened to your head what oh cabinet duh if i see chrissy ill tell him you were looking for him listen to me you two heels i mean business i got too much at stake you got something that belongs to me if you wanna get out of here alive give it back now im no blowhard tell him hes no blowhard hes had people killed before about six years ago there was this shut up you ain t gonna be telling nobody nothing pretty soon this is the image of me he leaves to the world i remember when he was born i would hold him in my arms he was an adorable kid too big eyes you always talk about him more like a son in some ways he was especially after his dad died he was little i used to give him rides id put him in the basket of the butcher bike and pedal him around back when satriales made deliveries i reminded him of that recently he didnt remember but you do we had fun all those memories and for what all i am to him is some asshole bully youre hurt his dad dickie was like my me to him a mentor yeah but more than that a friend a fucking guy you could look up to and the hope is that you pass that shit down the respect and the love all i did for this fucking kid and he fucking hates me so much im sure on some level he loves you too yeah take that home judge for yourself last five minutes should answer that im not going to do that not a horror fan its what you think that matters i think he fucking despises me its pretty obvious wants to

you in all seriousness that im done i did what you said i gave it a lot of thought and i decided that once and for all its over the truth is this therapy is a jerkoff you know it and i know it i actually dont know it but please continue its a jerkoff yes youve said that anyway i was coming here to quit had it all planned out but guess what my son is talking suicide so now im trapped here forever my god what did he say his girlfriend fiancée whatever she broke up with him hes beyond devastated would you like me to recommend someone for him to talk to carmelas getting a referral from his own pediatrician after that incompetent you sent meadow to so i suppose now comes the inherent fucking grilling about how i feel about all this isnt that why youre here you know friends of mine they got sons his age and theyre happy ambitious they fucking take life as it comes i know it seems that way but do you really know these other boys i know what i see my son curled up on the couch in a fetus position when he should be out banging coeds have you talked to him till im blue in the face we both have and now were afraid to talk to him because of what he might do obviously im prone to depression a certain bleak attitude about the world but i know i can handle it your kids though its like when theyre little and they get sick youd give anything in the world to trade places with them so they dont have to suffer and then to think youre the cause of it how are you the cause of it its in his blood this miserable fucking existence my rotten fucking putrid genes have infected my kids soul thats my gift to my son i know this is difficult but im very glad were having this discussion really really because i gotta be honest i think it fucking sucks what does therapy this i hate this fucking shit seriously were both adults here right so after all is said and done after all the complaining and the crying and all the fucking bullshit is this all there is yes welcome hi im chris im an alcoholic and drug addict hi chris i wanna go back to what stan said how not being able to socialize is hard when youre a salesman in my case its the same thing its actually taking food out of my daughters mouth my boss you know for all his bullshit encouragement how he respects what im doing the reality is he resents my sobriety i had the same thing at unicor they were all on board for the intervention but skip one golf outing and youre ostracized hes an enabler too this guy the worst fucking kind pours you a drink with one hand judges you with the other if you take it he wonders why im distant at least he says he does why i wanna branch out but i can promise you id have more money in my pocket plus more responsibility if i sat with him drinking watching that scotch drool out of his

baloney he leaves our granddaughter fatherless my only child drinking wont help honey jesus christ look at this syracuse is losing i dont know what to say what i just got a call from little paulie nucci gualtieri died stroke on the bus back to the home they had gone to see jersey boys this is difficult this is pain like im not used to weve said before he was like a son in some ways to see him die like that practically in my arms he was just starting his life yeah you know what this is bullshit what i havent been able to tell anybody this but im fucking relieved really he was a tremendous drag on my emotions on my thoughts about the future every morning i wake up thinking is today the day one of my best friends is gonna dime me to the fbi and a weak fucking sniveling lying drug addict thats the worst kind of bet the biggest blunder of my career is now gone and i dont have to be confronted by that fact no more and as a relative a friend someone you can count on i see let me tell you something ive murdered friends before even relatives my cousin tony my best friend puss but this was i talking in my sleep snoring im gonna put on the tv if you dont mind i cant stay asleep either im all i mean i can laugh and cry and i could always get the part first time first time never could keep it they got onto me after a while id lose my voice fall down get red in the face talk too fast and couldnt act can you make me a cappuccino that fucking machine from paulie you need a pilots license its so hard not to think of christopher as a child isnt it caity kind of looks like him which makes it doubly hard of course thats not gonna do her any favors when she hits puberty that schnoz a lot of women found him very attractive i think to myself how could i have ever said those things about him about him and adriana what her mother said he did to her obviously he was violent as an adult his upbringing but he adored ade he could never let himself take her life why are we so quick to blame what is the attraction in that its good thank you when i called you the night after the accident and you asked me oh my god tony hes dead yeah and i thought well i thought i picked up a twinge of relief what it just seemed like i dont know how could you say that you dont know what youre saying okay good im wrong if you did pick up something like that maybe its because i was relieved that it was him and not you well dont feel bad about that that makes sense to be going down to the hospital again at 2 in the morning and you know what when you were shot it was christopher who held me you know the babys car seat a giant tree branch came through the window and demolished it she would have been dead caitlin mangled beyond recognition i told her about the baby seat so she wouldnt feel so rotten he was high as a fucking kite i didnt tell her that in retrospect maybe not the best approach right im the asshole again what no go ahead its amazing how things work his mother my cousin joanne a lush totally abandoned him as a parent but now shes reaping all the sympathy and the tears how are you doing anthony there have been some hard moments but a weak lying drug addict who fantasized about my downfall who showed people his filthy thoughts on a movie screen let me tell you something ive seen friends die before accidents even murder my cousin tony they shot his face away and i was fucking prostate with grief but this i see and it occurs to me i handcarried this kid through the worst crisis he ever had i cant go into particulars but wives girlfriends they can complicate life in a major way i dont have to tell you that anyway huge problem of his own making and he cried he couldnt deal with it so i took up the slack i handled it i felt sorry for him now he talked gratitude but guess what pity produces in the recipient they shit on your pity and thats what broke the camels back how are you handling all this the worst part truthfully is i gotta sit there with people who are hurting bad and i gotta have the long face and the sighing and the platitudes but i dont feel it then that makes me feel like a hypocrite and that makes me mad at them oh hi how are you julianna skiffle this is my wife carmela soprano skiff oh yeah right juliannas a real estate agent in the old neighborhood and you knew christopher i used to buy my meat at satriales im a recovering addict i owe him a lot thats nice to hear well what are you gonna do huh nothing you can do thats my point he was too young goodlooking woman they did a beautiful job on him oh im gonna go up ill go up later give my seat to someone in the meantime how are you doing its tough yeah he loved you so much yeah well you know he did okay ill go up later there she is 3 to 5 7 to 9 why do they call her that she never misses a wake oh lord fucking james brown now im serious i cant take it its all right were here for you oh my god look at this like a movie star jackie kennedy im sorry for the loss of your cousin thanks me too bro me too he was a good guy hey dont let this linger on your head now you know what im talking about you know that night a tree limb came in through the car window completely

worthwhile you have no idea of course not dont get sarcastic i really think its law for me i mean you should hear patrick talk about the justice system and what it means its really inspiring obviously sheila resents me im dating her father the sullen looks the transference to me of her issues with her mom as your favorite patient says maybe i should put my shoe up her ass which patient of mine says that mine elliot your favorite patient of mine he hasnt been in the paper much lately you miss that dont you my father was a rabid untouchables fan make of that what you will what elliot i ran into nancy duggan last week do you know nancy vaguely shes on staff at rikers island works with a lot of sociopaths as you can imagine anyway she told me something interesting a lot of studies about talk therapy as it relates to sociopaths and criminals one of them is the criminal personality conducted by yochelson at st elizabeths essentially it concludes that talk therapy while not only being useless with sociopaths actually serves to validate them yochelson says they sharpen their skills as conmen on their therapists crocodile tears what have you why are you smirking im not oh really he showed data the oneyear reconviction rates were higher for offenders in therapy than for those receiving no treatment at all some peppers and cheese gorgonzola all right dont forget sit down sit down easy easy you motherfucker my fucking daughter my fucking daughter you motherfucker my fucking daughter hey want some sambuca with this tony youre making a big fucking mistake here how about i put a bullet in your fucking head huh dont do it you want some its always what you think isnt it its never how i feel oh poor you its all your mothers fault isnt it i didnt say that youre a mamas boy youre gonna call me names now no one is calling anyone any names how about my confirmation you called me an animal i did not i was in the garage and you said what kind of animal smokes marijuana at his confirmation he was using illegal drugs in the home did it ever occur to you that i might have been selfmedicating give me a break will you and how about second grade you made me show up to school in that dorky raincoat i got beat up because of it you would hole up in that room for hours because i was never really secure expressing my feelings in that house i mean thats why what kind of poem is that to teach college students would you like to tell your parents what your grandmother said my mother grandma dads mom whatd she say that its all a big nothing what is life that was her all right okay fine she said those kinds of things she sat up in bed when she could hardly move she could hardly breathe she said in the end that your friends and family let you down and that you die in your own arms when was this when she was in that nursing home and you used to make me go see her were not too young to be grandpas tony carmine lupertazzi ill see you later skip all right we should have dinner you know carm donna maybe the kids yeah i hear wedding bells are in the air you want anything no im good if theres anything i can do tony for anthony jr thank you when alexandra had that bout of anorexia we had this terrific psychologist she tried to kill herself your daughter no she had serious problems though didnt she not really its all under control so the reason im here you could

a plumbing strike as we speak well fuck it let him easy for you i have the scaffolding contract oh is that what this is about carmine what do i owe you come on huh you know me better than that my daughter carmine my daughter you got a little girl you almost killed the guy i shouldve killed him id have had total support but i held myself back you were being prudent fuck that i lost it timing couldnt have been worse but what the fuck so you go to phil i go with you hats in hand bended knees why me huh doesnt every parent make mistakes why not you because im a good guy basically i love my family theres a balance theres a ying and a yang you think you know you think you learned something like when i got shot know what all right when i was in las vegas i took peyote curiosity i dont know you were searching for something well i saw some things not things per se hallucinations roger corman shit was disappointing there wasnt any of that what was there its kind of hard to describe i mean youve done it right acid shit like that no all i can say is i saw for pretty certain that this everything we see and experience is not all there is what else is there something else but thats as far as im gonna go with it i dont fucking know alternate universes you gonna be a fucking comedian now im not maybe this is gonna sound stupid but i saw at one point that our mothers are theyre bus drivers no they are the bus see theyre the vehicle that gets us here they drop us off and go on their way they continue on their journey and the problem is that we keep trying to get back on the bus instead of just letting it go thats very insightful well jesus dont act so surprised you know you have these thoughts and you almost grab it butch how are you phil is not accepting visitors right now i just talked to him on the phone butchie i just talked to him in person he aint seeing nobody whats going on butch i just brokered this thing he came here to make a peace offering a semitrailer of

toy terriers a shit machine i talked to some of the guys about your misgivings yeah listen ive made a decision take a walk in there what the fuck you waiting for get lost historically carmine always said the sopranos are nothing more than a glorified crew plain and simple we decapitate and we do business with whatevers left what nothing i agree in spirit but i gotta counsel this thing should have been done during johns era they got redundant upper management bleeds off half the kick we take em out absorb the whole fucking thing take out an entire fucking family let me tell you a couple or three things forget coco forget fat dom who goes over to jersey and never comes back forget my brother billy phil phil thats not what im saying at all anthony soprano has no respect for this thing hes never been in the can not really hes a guy who stepped over his own uncle to grab the big seat his fathers brother please huh im embarrassed i let him come to the hospital last christmas and i took his fat fucking hand in friendship philly you had a heart attack listen to me they make anybody and everybody over there and the way that they do it is all fucked up guys dont get their finger pricked

outfit protected the brooklyn navy yard you think roosevelt told vito genovese where hitler was holed up go fuck yourself tony tony hold up tony what look i appreciate what you did giving us those names in fact ive been sitting here thinking remember that thing i told you about that was supposed to happen about a year ago your problem with brooklyn its on again possibly you maybe people close to you if it was real solid you would have been warned officially by the newark office but my colleague in brooklyn the one with the collaborator snitch is implying the wheels have already been set in

with new york burt measures were taken burt wasnt speaking for just himself guys are getting squeezed hard to sway them towards new management they thought youd be a part of it and he got an answer my hope is maybe now phil gets the message you know we can talk this shit through talk talking about phil were gonna hit first and this all dovetails with other information i got that this cocksucker already has a target on my back its a big move so buddha when he stuck you with the tab for vito jr i said let it go obviously truth is a fuck like phil appeasement dont work oh yeah three pops within a tight time frame 24 hours so theres no chance for them to hit back top three guys paulie gaultieri no management tony soprano obviously plus silvio dante and we think bobby baccalieri that mortadellas number three he used to be junior sopranos driver and you used to sell laser printers out the back of your crown vic you really slept yeah i wasnt asleep you want some oatmeal ill make

torrid penandpaper relationship with an armed robber in attica what is this fascination with criminals rescue fantasy they think they can fix them im worried for cecily so l googled any new stuff on sociopathic personalities apparently the talking cure actually helps them become better criminals it was fascinating the study was by yochelson and samenow studies turn around every few years this other i think it was robert hare suggested that sociopaths actually quite glibly engage on key issues like mother family i seem to remember that from residency me too and lve read hare but whos a true sociopath i had a guy at the state asylum slow poisoner they even mimic empathy they blubber and cry did you put her up to this she just happened to mention this study who me everything okay down there i dont know its a study food for thought shes blowing us off you just cant resist rubbing my face in it i feel like we should change the subject i only suggested you reevaluate your work with leadbelly or be prepared to deal with moral and possibly legal consequences leadbelly whos that come on the answer is a female opera singer and gangster elliot soprano tony soprano hes your patient wow thats pretty cool jesus christ elliot chill out were among friends were all professionals so whats your verdict on the wine jen all italians have big noses if l had made that joke about other groups represented at this table i would be called a bigot i meant ltalian reds still it must be fascinating work it is have a seat whats up phil leotardo calls were made to zips theyre coming over from naples you contact the guy to contact the guys phils at his goomars every friday night t know about this what what kind of question is that watch your fat fucking mouth hey whoa whoa whoa whoa what are you concerned about i lived through the 70s by the skin of my nuts when the columbos were going at it there aint a bigger cocksucker than phil leotardo i just wanna make sure somebody knows there could be a line of cozarellis a mile long duly noted so theres no problem then dont worry about them paulie those guys are outside fuck you talking so loud for dont discuss this until were in the piscia dun its all yours i just picked em up at the airport anthony so what do you clear a year around here i dont mean to pry you know just round numbers im asking because meadow well i told you

still working yeah but youre divorced criminal law thats what shes taking up and i told carmela its not the end of the world shes interested in civil rights muslims and blacks and that and a dime hopefully shell wind up at a big firm whitecollar crime just you know dr soprano sounds nice your parents must have been very proud i think so look at all the people like me youve helped with all the human suffering in this world youve done something important like those people who are trying to help my son god bless em 2000 a day in that place but if it helps and as you know my plumbers union insurance only covers 10 of mental hes really hurting aj and you although maybe you know you know what forget his hurts maybe i should have just put your shoe up his ass yeah yeah frankly well we talked about this untalked about it huh anyway carmela mollycoddled him my old man are you a shining example for the huge collection of wingtips and loafers that must be lodged up your lower bowel whats the matter with you is it because l said that about being divorced you were saying hes my only son hes young most of the time they pull out of this but lve been depressed for years what if he dont pull out so the boy who never cared about anything now cares about too much yeah i guess and the daughter like all females ultimately somehow disappoints i didnt say that oh whats with the tone
