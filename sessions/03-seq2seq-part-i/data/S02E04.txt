All riglnt, l gotta go, fellas.
Joey, nice to meet you. You, Mr. Rude Cocksucker.. .

Eat your manicotti.
God forgive me.
When he did come home tlnat day. ..
. ..l was upstairs.
l heard the door and then his voice, ''l'm lnome.''
l fucking wanted to vomit.
After all that worry he might be dead, praying lne was okay.
My heart just sank and l wislned--
He had died.
To just come and go year after year like that.
How dare he?
Have you reaclned out to him?
Tlnat's a good one.
Listen.
And l don't want my kids to know tlnis.
Tlney found a lump under my arm.
Tlney biopsied it. l get tlne results in a few days.
Anyway, l told Sal.
He said, ''Jesus Clnrist,'' kind of alarmed, a little.
Tlnen lne went back to wlnatever lne was doing.

Nino is happy to be at your disposal.
My uncle's problem was lne went to the Russians for the cars.
Tlney kept the best stuff, slnipped it off to St. Petersburg.. .

lt's not permission. lt was just an idea.
You know wlnat? Fine, l'll hang up.

-A man like wlnat? -The attitude, tlne medieval outlook.
He is sucln an adoring fatlner, though.

Madonna/whore is the full equation, l believe.
Clotlnes. ..
. ..and appliances. ..
. ..and houses.
You are talking about me? About us?
Carmela, no.

Tlnat a woman of your intelligence. ..

Family is a sacred institution.

What can l do for you?
-You could introduce me to tlne boss. -You can talk to me.
A fucking woman boss?
-So, what do you want? -Never happen in the States. Never.
Our men kill each other.
All my brothers, for example. Tlney all got murdered.
Or they go to prison.
Rome lnas a war against us.
But tlne men are in love to tlneir mama, huh?
So obeying a woman is not--
Come si dice? lt comes natural.
Well, l'll be dipped in shit.
You act like your father's nursemaid.
l am his nursemaid.
lf an old man carries tlne respect of tlne troops, you keep him around.

You want them?
lf your enemy comes into possession of your nail or hair clippings.. .
. ..tlney can make tlne evil on you.
l'm flattered you'd trust me, but can l pass without ruining tlne moment?

Cocksuckers.
A lot of guys become soft living in America.
Not one in five guys, they're a fucking rat.
Can't find anybody tlnat believes in tlne old ways:
Keeping silent. Putting the family first.
So you want Naples' guys.
Fucking clairvoyant over lnere.
Tlnat way l get guys with no ties over there.
Tlney'd be loyal to me, 1 1 0 percent.
-Wlnat? -Wlnat do l get?
You get an obvious advantage to having your guys there.
-How mucln you pay me for tlnis man? -Pay you?
Your profitability is gonna go way up.
Who are you thinking?
-Well, Furio to start. -Furio!
-Take it easy! -l give you one of my best men. ..
. ..and all l get are numbers in the air!
Witln all due respect, hon, you're being slnortsiglnted.
He's my cousin, one of my best men. lt's not gonna happen.
-l'm asking you nice. -Or what?
Hey, look, l don't even think you understand--
-Talk to your lnusband. -My lnusband? Fuck you!
He's never coming back. You lnave to fucking deal with me.
Up your ass!
-You're up. -Wlnere's my otlner belt?
-Did you look under the bed? -Fuck, yealn!
-l just came from the doctor's office. -Yealn?

-Wlnat are you gonna do? -A woman boss?
-ln America you don't lnave? -No.

-Come down to eat. -Jesus, is that all you people do?
We had a huge lunch.
-We need to finisln our business. -l said all l'm gonna say.
All riglnt, l'm coming down.
Yeah, l know. For indigestion, right?
Clneers.
So, wlnat is tlnis place?
My fatlner was born in tlnis lnouse.
Later, we make the new one.
You were born here and your kids are raised next door.
lt's a nice tlning.
You take good care of your father.
What are you going to do? Send him to ospizio?
Hey.
Listen. .. .
Tlnis one needs to be stayed with until lne goes to sleep, huh?
l'll take you back in tlne morning.
Good niglnt.

-You're gonna take Monday to think? -Monday's a Jewisln lnoliday.

God gave me more years, Carmela.
Tlnis very morning, God gave me a gift!
And l will use that gift!
l won't waste it like l've wasted 24 fucking years witln this man!
You know wlnat the Clnurch says about divorce.
Let the pope live witln lnim.
What about tlne kids?
Tlney're 1 9, 21 and 24. lt's time we all grew up.
Kevin is just starting lnis soplnomore year of college.
He'll know you stayed together, waiting for lnim to leave.
He only cares about not losing privileges at our house on tlne shore.
He's so fond of lnis father. Tlnat's all l'm saying.
And Terri and Scott witln their money problems and tlne pregnancy. .. .
You want to set this example wlnen your daughter's struggling. ..
. ..to keep her marriage alive?
-Wlny are you working tlnis lnard? -Wlny?
For all of tlne reasons l just said. Because you are my friend.
l'm not even saying don't.
At the very least, you gotta ask yourself these questions.
Tlney're not even sure Terri can lnave children of her own.
Sal began to cry wlnen lne heard that.
Oh, lnoney. Come lnere.
ln the end, l know you're not gonna leave lnim.
l know you won't do that.
l'm from America.
Hey, cara mia, on your way back.. .
. ..bring me one of those plums from tlne breakfast tray.
Never mind.

None of them fucking steroids.
Come si dice ''steroids''?
Tlnere you go. Who said you're not a great conversationalist?
Fucking twat.
Tlnere's my little fragolina.
Hey, the customer's always right.
Did l say you should leave?
You know, my grandfather was Neapolitan.
He went to America in 1 91 0.
Tlnree thousand miles.. .
All by himself.

Some of tlne guys are Sicilians.
Hotheaded bastards. Am l right?
So, wlnat part of Naples you from?
Ariano lrpino.
You're slnitting me! Tlnat's where my grandfather's from.
We come from the same town!
Our families probably know eacln otlner.
Tlne island back there is called Progida.
Madonna, look at tlnis.
l gotta bring my kids here.
Show them all this.
ln olden time, tlne Sibyl of Cumae. ..
. ..was tlne second most important oracle after Delplni.
-l thought Delphi was in Greece. -The Greeks were here.
Way before tlne Romans.
And before tlne Greeks, there was somebody else.
And before tlnem, somebody else.
''Rulers would come from across tlne world.. .
. ..to lnear the Sibyl's predictions of tlneir future.
She would sit inside the cave inhaling gases--''
l tlnink l dated tlnis broad.
''--possibly volcanic, no longer active, and would speak in a voice not her own.
Delivering unto tlnem tlneir fates.''
Let's go into the cave.
Tlne Sibyl sat way back there. See that shaft of liglnt?
lt's a fucking trip.
Tlne Sibyl were very beautiful in most cases.
Oh, yealn?
Got a premonition for me?
You?
You're no problem to read.
-You are your own worst enemy. -Oln, is that riglnt?
Riglnt now, you remind me of somebody from back home.
Not your wife.
-Your girlfriend? -Oln, l got one.
To answer your question.
But no.
Not lner.
But she's someone you want to fuck.
l can tell.
Oh, really?
You know, everybody's their own worst enemy.
So maybe your psyclnic power lnas been overrated a little bit.
You don't want to fuck lner?
You don't want to fuck me?
Yeah, l do.
But l don't slnit where l eat.
lt's bad business. We're in business.
Not at tlnose price.
