Anthony Soprano,
Detective Gaudioso, Essex County.

I have a warrant for your arrest.

- For what?
- Are you Anthony Soprano?

What, did you bring
the whole county with you?

We don't take any chances
when it concerns an illegal firearm

containing hollow-point
ammunition.

What?

Where's the FBI?

Can I see a warrant?
We have the right.

Did you talk to Tony about
coming up to the lake for his birthday?

Tony was arrested
this morning.

- For what?
- Weapons charge.

They're booking him in North Caldwell
before they take him to Newark.

- I'm dropping off his clothes.
- It's a gun, no big deal.

Hollow-point ammunition,
they said.

Yeah, well,
he'll still make bail.

You know he's not wild
about the drive, Janice.

I really think it's
not the time right now.

Well, let him know
we're with him.

All right.

If you have hollow-point bullets
in anything, take 'em out today.

Oh, God damn it, AJ,
there is tomato sauce

all over these pants.

AJ, I asked

You're my favorite turd.

it's more than one.

Thank God. I really didn't want it
hanging over your birthday.

Can we forget already

You say that and then you get upset

Anthony Jereboam Soprano.

What's up?

Tony seem to hit the hooch
a little at lunch today?

I think he's feeling
his age.

What do you think
it's like for me?

When we were kids,

he'd do whatever I said.

He ate one of Tippy's Milk-Bones
because I told him it was a cookie.

My therapist Sandy,

she said my Ma
was a splitter.

She'd pit us three
against each other...

to toughen us up,
I guess.

I couldn't help hearing
you with AJ.

God, you gotta walk on eggshells
with these kids today, huh?

We're almost through that phase,
thank God.

You're good with them.

Really? I wish
he'd go back to college.

He sleeps most nights
at Blanca's.

Speaking of kids and Ma,

Sandy said something
interesting...

that when we were babies,

everything was fine,

but Ma couldn't stand
that as her babies got older,

they separated from her.

When they started
to talk and express ideas,

that's when
the trouble started.

It wasn't that
she didn't love us.

Mmm-mmm!

You've been a solid
performer for some time now.

Plus, you're my
brother-in-law.

You get older,
you think about things.

You're a young man.
We both are.

- World's still in front of us.
- Balls.

My estimate historically,

80% of the time it ends up
in the can like Johnny Sack

or on the embalming table
at Cozarelli's.

Don't even say it.

No risk, no reward.

I mean, yeah, our line of work,
it's always out there.

You probably don't even hear it
when it happens, right?

Ask your friend
in there on the wall.

Listen to us.
Morbid fucks.

Come to think of it, you never popped
your cherry in that regard, right?

No.

Yet your old man was
the fucking Terminator.

I come close.

I done other shit,
but no.

A salut'.

It's a big fat pain
in the balls.

Especially now
with DNA evidence.

My pop never
wanted it for me.

He said there were times
with all the worry

that he wished he could
have stayed in the shop full-time,

just cut hair.

To be honest, I'd rather
he fucking shot me than cut my hair.

There's somebody I've been
bringing along to insulate myself

from the stuff that
could bring down a boss,

and take care of Carmela
too, in case...

God forbid.

Now maybe

between me
and this person...

there's diverging agendas.

- Sorry to hear it.
- It happens.

Thing is, the Newark
facilities manager,

he's gonna fix it so we do all the
window replacements

in the projects.

I was thinking maybe
you should work that.

I'm honored just
to be considered.

Then we'll see what
happens after that, long-term.

Than who?

Tony, for example.

So, what are you saying?
He's more like your mother?

No.

Listen, he's got that
temper too.

In the end he went
his separate way.

Who?

My boyfriend.

I'm not proud
of it, though.

Sounds like he deserved it.

(MOTORBOAT PASSING)

My mother, though,

she could lay out in
the weeds for days, years,

waiting to strike.

That verbal diarrhea,

when you got something in
that head of yours, Janice,

you give yourself away. What are you
saying about my husband?

What... what did I say?

I don't know what goes
on in your house,

but for your information, Tony has
never raised his hand to his children.

Nothing goes on
in my house.

- Or to me.
- Fine.

But you know what,
I take that back.

Once he slapped AJ,
and he felt horrible about it...

for days.

Bobby took advantage of him
last night

when Tony had had
too much to drink.

There is no excuse for the way
Bobby blindsided him.

Tony is not
a vindictive man.

What did I say?

(SCREEN DOOR OPENS)

(MUSIC PLAYING,
BILLIARD BALLS STRIKING)

You had a pretty good success
with the Lipitor, right?

Well, at this moment we could
also sell to you Fosamax.

Medication for...

osteo... osteporose, you know,
for the women, their bones.

Now, one month's
supply of Fosamax,

four pilules... pills,

sells for $70 U.S.
from the pharmacy.

We sell four pills
to you for $10 U.S.

- What, are they counterfeit?
- No no no.

They're true. They're
from Assurance Maladie,

but expiree...
like, old.

Change the date,
nobody knows.

How much... Fosamax
can you get?

20,000 pills
every three months.

There some way we could
get you to lower your price?

You already make
a big profit.

That's a good deal.

And we'll give you the first pills
in one week, Monday.

(SPEAKING FRENCH)

What?

I cannot come
the week next

because ma soeur...
my sister,

she has problems
in the court.

She got a good lawyer?

Makes all the difference.

Her old husband, he wants to take
the child they have together

to Winnipeg, because
he's some drummer over there.

- Can you believe this?
- She never see her son.

Separate a child
from his mother?

I mean, what kind
of person does this?

I would give anything to be, you know,
debarasse of this shit.

To have him gone
from her life...

That's tough
talk, bon ami.

I'm really serious.

I tell you what:

you knock your price
down to 35 grande

and we'll see what we can do about
making your sister's custody problem...

go away.

And I'm not talking
about a lawyer, either.

Now, who does this?

You pay to some
drug addict?

No, somebody reliable.

(SPEAKS FRENCH)

We got to talk.

You'll take care
of this, right?

Sure.

No bow and arrows now.

- Ooh.
- (HONKING)

Nice, huh?

Bobby...
(LAUGHS)

Hi, hi.

Mwah!

Oh, how was the game?

Oh, you know,
he held his own, but...

Must have been
the new clubs.

- Yeah.
- Do you want to eat something?

No no, I figure we
should hit the road,

beat the traffic.

Okay.

You let him win.
Smart.

Drive carefully.

Here.

Thanks again
for my present.

Oh, wait till you see the shots
of Aunt Gemma from the '60s.

You forget what a beauty
she was before the steroids.

- Bobby, you're a wonderful host.
- It was our pleasure.

Goodbye. When Nica
wakes up from her nap,

give her a belly
smooch from us.

Okay. Bye.

(HONKS HORN)

He broke your balls
about the fight, didn't he?

No, he didn't.

(ZIPPING)

Bobby?

Where are you going?

- It's business, Jan.
- Now?

- Yeah.
- Well, when are you coming back?

I'm not sure.
A couple days.

A couple of days?
The Salernos are coming tomorrow.

Stop fucking nagging me.

I'll be back
as soon as I can.

(INDISTINCT
FRENCH RADIO)

(OBJECTS TUMBLING)

- Allo, Natalie.
- Salut.

- (BULLET TUMBLING)
- (COUGHING)

(NO SOUND)

(CELL PHONE RINGING)

Yeah?

Some news about this
gun charge:

- it's not going away.
- You said they dropped it.

Essex County did, but now
looks like the feds took it over.

Fuck.

What happened to
"It's a piece-of-shit case"?

It is.
Unwinnable.

But fold it into a RICO,
it adds a predicate.

Good news is if they
had what they needed

we'd be having this
conversation through glass.

I gotta go.

('50S ROCK PLAYING)

Girls, let's do
the tea now.

Pour a little
for Jamie too.

- Bobby, finally!
- Hey, Bobby.

Daddy!
